My research focuses on the privacy, security, and data protection challenges posed by emerging technologies. I aim to better understand how these technologies affect individuals and communities, with a particular focus on addressing privacy risks, improving policy frameworks, and developing practical solutions for connected systems, medical devices, and energy technologies.


## Smart Technology Analytics and Protection Lab

At the Smart Technology Analytics and Protection Lab (STAPL), I investigate privacy and security risks in smart technologies through advanced analytics, policy evaluation, and privacy frameworks. My work brings together technical, human, and policy perspectives to support safe, real-world innovation in connected systems.


### Current Projects in STAPL

1. **Identifying Gaps in Smart Tech Privacy Research**  
   I examine the current state of smart technology privacy studies to identify gaps in user representation and geographic focus. My goal is to inform future research that addresses overlooked privacy concerns and supports better data protection for underserved groups.


2. **Privacy Policy Evaluation Framework for IoMT Devices**  
   Iâ€™ve developed a framework to evaluate the privacy policies of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. By leveraging NLP and machine learning tools, my framework automatically detects privacy risks and compliance issues, empowering manufacturers and policymakers to ensure safer practices in medical technology.

## **Threat Intelligence and Privacy Solutions (TIPS) Lab**

In the TIPS Lab, I specialize in cyber threat analysis, improving privacy protections, and ensuring organizations respond to security incidents without compromising user privacy. I leverage data-driven techniques to develop proactive, real-time solutions for emerging technologies, focusing on privacy risks in connected systems.


### **Current Projects in TIPS Lab**

1. **Privacy Threat Detection in IoMT Network Traffic**  
   I explore privacy risks in IoMT networks by analyzing real-time network traffic. My research evaluates compliance with privacy regulations and identifies potential threats to user data, promoting stronger privacy protection mechanisms in healthcare and medical devices.
