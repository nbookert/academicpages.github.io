This guide is a curated collection of tools, resources, and advice for students who may feel overwhelmed or unsure of where to start. It’s not an exhaustive list, but it’s a great starting point to help you gain confidence and get on the right track. The resources here are things I share in my classes, during mentoring, and through outreach. I stand by them because they’ve made a real difference in my own journey and in the journeys of those I’ve worked with.

Key Takeaways: 
:   1. Quantity Breeds Quality: Remember the more you practice or create, the better you get at it. Improvement comes from repetition and persistence. If you need ideas on where to start visit [Practice & Project](#1-practice--projects) and [Tools & Technologies](#2-tools--technologies).

    2. Everyone should try to complete at least one experiential learning experience (read internship or related experience). Start your search early! Find out more at [Real-World Experience](#3-experiential-learning)

    3. Everyone needs a mentor! You don't know what you don't know. Be curious, ask questions, and admit you need help.

 **Programming**: You should be comfortable with the basics of at least one programming language, such as Java, C/C++, or Python. At a minimum, this includes reading code, working with variables, understanding branching and loops, and defining and calling functions. A good way to choose a language is to look at job postings related to the roles you're interested in.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/): Code repository platform where you can store your projects and portfolio, while also practicing version control using Git. Students can take advantage of [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education), which provides free access to GitHub Pro and a variety of other tools and resources.

  - ***Where to Find***:  
    - University Career Services – A great starting point for curated, school-specific opportunities  
    - Company Websites – Check the careers section of companies you're interested in  
    - Online Job Portals – Websites like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed  
    - USAJobs.gov – For federal government internships

  - ***When to Apply***:  As early as one year before the internship begins (e.g., Summer 2026 internships may open by February 2025)

- **Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs)**: 

  - ***Description***:  Participate in hands-on research alongside university faculty and researchers on funded projects.

  - ***Benefits***: Paid opportunities, and generally include travel and housing expenses. Valuable experience working on real research problems.

  - ***Where to Find***:  
    - University Websites – Faculty may post research opportunities on their department or personal pages  
    - NSF REU Database – A comprehensive resource for NSF-funded research experiences https://etap.nsf.gov

  - ***When to Apply***:  Most REUs open in late fall or early spring (e.g., Summer 2026 REUs open November 2025 – March 2026)
  
Even if its something you don't like, this affirms or validates your concerns and may introduce you to something new.
